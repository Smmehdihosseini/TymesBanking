## What is Time Banking?

Time banking is a system of bartering various services for one another using labor-time as a unit of account which was developed by various socialist thinkers based on the labor theory of value. Labor-time units can be credited to a personâ€™s account in the time bank and redeemed for services from other members of the time bank. Time banking can be considered a form of community currency. However, because the labor-time units of account are not generally accepted outside the membership of the time bank, nor for general goods traded in the market other than specific labor services, it does not constitute a form of money in an economic sense outside the inherently limited context of the time bank itself.
